I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), working with the [Machine Learning group @ SPIRAL](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/) supervised by [Professor Jennifer Dy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6h7b0fAAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research interests include continual learning, adversarial attacks, and leveraging them for transparent and interpretable machine learning. Additionally, I have worked on unsupervised 3D reconstruction and classification, time-series forecasting and implicit neural networks. 

Previously, I worked as an AI and ML consultant with [Endress+Hauser, Germany](https://www.endress.com/en). I completed my Masters in EE at the [Robotics and Computer Vision](http://rcv.kaist.ac.kr/index.php?mid=rcv_01_01) lab at [KAIST, South Korea](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). I worked on occlusion‐robust vehicle re‐identification, and on utilizing adversarial attacks for understanding deep networks with relevant publications.

Besides my academic interests, I enjoy public speaking, community service, and reading biographies.
